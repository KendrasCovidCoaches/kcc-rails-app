<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>We're reaching out to thank you and express our gratitude for volunteering. While it is looking bleak right now, it is amazing seeing the immense number of people and companies that have stepped up to work together to fight this virus. To echo what Balaji Srinivasan said <%= link_to "we need a new Manhattan Appointment", "https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1240807742257811456", target: "_blank" %>, and this time it will be distributed, decentralized, and require all of us to help out.</p>

<p>HWC is just a tiny part of this global effort. At the same time with ~3,500 people in the directory, ~1,000+ on Discord, and ~200 Appointments this effort seems to have struck a nerve.</p>

<p>And we have a couple of asks. We didn't design HWC for this many volunteers and we want to start a more structured approach. There are so much information and so many Appointments out there that feel the next step is about curation and figuring out what's gaining traction and can be impactful. We kindly ask you to:</p>


<p>Thank you again for everything!<br/>
  The HWC Volunteer team</p>
